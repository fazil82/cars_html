<h3>The Mahindra Thar is a compact, four-wheel drive, off-road SUV manufactured by Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. HistoryThe Thar was first introduced in 2010 as a modernized version of the Mahindra Legend, which was based on the Mahindra MM540, a vehicle that was in production in India since the 1980s.

    The Mahindra Thar was designed to be a rugged, reliable, and affordable off-road vehicle that could handle the rough terrain found in many parts of India. The Thar's design is based on the iconic Jeep CJ series, which Mahindra had been producing under license since the 1940s.
    
    The first generation Mahindra Thar was powered by a 2.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine that produced 105 horsepower and 247 Nm of torque. The vehicle was available in two trim levels: the DI 2WD and the DI 4WD. The DI 2WD was a basic version that came with a soft top and no air conditioning, while the DI 4WD came with air conditioning and a hardtop. In 2015, Mahindra introduced an updated version of the Thar called the Thar CRDe. The CRDe stood for "common rail diesel engine," which was a more advanced engine that produced 105 horsepower and 247 Nm of torque. The Thar CRDe also had updated safety features, such as airbags and ABS, and was available in two trim levels: the CRDe 4WD and the CRDe 4WD AC.
    
    In 2020, Mahindra introduced the second generation Thar, which was a completely redesigned version of the vehicle. The Thar 2020 has a new, more modern design that features a bold grille, LED headlights, and a hardtop roof. It is powered by either a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine or a 2.2-liter turbocharged diesel engine, both of which are mated to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. The Thar 2020 also has updated suspension and drivetrain components, as well as a range of new features, such as a touchscreen infotainment system, a rearview camera, and an adventure statistics display. The Thar 2020 is available in two trim levels: the AX and the LX, with the latter being the more premium option.
    
    The Mahindra Thar has been well-received by both off-road enthusiasts and the general public in India. It has become a popular vehicle for adventure enthusiasts, as it is capable of handling some of the most challenging terrains in India.

<h3>The Toyota Supra is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3]

    The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.
    
    The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also discontinued.[citation needed]
    
    In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth generation of the Supra in the United States.[6] Production of the fourth generation of the Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the fifth generation of the Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 Z4, was introduced.[7]</h3>
